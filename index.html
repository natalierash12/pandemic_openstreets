<p>According to <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Open-Streets-Locations/uiay-nctu"> NYC Open Data</a>, each borough in New York has seen an increase in the number of Open Streets locations made available for pedestrians and cyclists for purposes of social distancing and keeping more cars off of roads.</p>

<p>Jacob DeCastro, a representative from Transportation Alternatives, said that this shift was intensified by the pandemic and has helped to make residents in all boroughs feel safer. Transportation Alternatives did <a href="https://www.transalt.org/open-streets-forever-nyc"> a study</a> with Sienna College that found 63 percent of New York City voters and 57 percent of car-owning households in the city supported the Open Streets program, which DeCastro cites as a sign of how successful these initiatives has become, and how they will likely continue to expand in the future.</p>

<p>"This just shows how popular the program has become since it was announced. Whether it's the safety benefits or having more space to move around outside, they're becoming very popular and beloved in the neighborhood spacer," he said. "This push for closing streets to cars isn't new, but the pandemic has certainly accelerated that and shifted what people think is possible."</p>

<p>The map below illustrates this shift, and shows the increase in Open Streets locations in New York by each borough from 2020 to 2021. In most boroughs, the amount of Open Streets locations with both full and temporary access more than doubled since 2020 and into the following year.</p>
